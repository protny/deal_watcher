refresh from github main branch
move all documentation to separate documents folder, if there are many documents conceerning separate areas divide them accordingly into subdirectories
create additional documents 
- one called _work.md summarizing what was done, what future development needs to be done and what you suggest as the next plan
- another one called _quick_summary.md - containing concise description of executable scripts and how to use them and of the documents with a very concise description of their content

make sure there is no unnecessary duplicate information in the documents and remove/edit old todos  or task documents that have already been implemented. if any documents logically should be joined such as 3 different todos - do so

go through code and ensure all is well documented inline

after you are done recheck if the project structure is readable and if all is where it should be - the aim is for the directory structure and files to be well organized allowing to resume work on this project even after a longer pause

i dont want to see any documentation (other than README.md and CLAUDE.md) in the main or src folder 

temporary, miscelaneus, testing, migration scripts should be moved to a subfolder
